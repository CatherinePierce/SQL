# SQL
The purpose of this course is to provide basic Structured Query Language (SQL) skills and to explain how SQL could help you in business or academic career. An overview of the SQL syntax together with lots of practice will allow you to obtain experience that might be helpful for your future life.
The following topics will be covered during the course:
• Why do you need SQL. Dialects of the language and different DBMS. Data types. Casting of
types. The SELECT statement. Restrictions on output in different DBMS or why it is not
recommended to do SELECT *. The CASE expression and simple value processing. Tricky
NULL.
• Why can't all the data be put into one table or why do you need the JOIN operator.
Database normalization: how it should be and how it really is. Connection types, foreign
keys, indices. What is the difference between JOIN and UNION (intersect/except).
• Limitations on output. The WHERE operator. How to display all users with last name
ending with “ev” or what is LIKE.
• Measuring the average: aggregate functions GROUP BY and HAVING.
• Subqueries. Generating lists of dates. Recursive subqueries and what are they useful for.
SELECT from DUAL in Oracle or how do I get constants.
• Window functions: moving average, top n and others. OVER, PARTITION BY, ORDERED
BY and other keywords.
• Everything you don't need as an analyst, though it turns out useful once. Permissions,
users and roles. Updating and deleting data, Truncate vs Delete, triggers on tables.
Procedures, functions and small automation. How can you make Python and SQL become
friends. Connectors to different types of databases. How SQL is similar to Pandas.
